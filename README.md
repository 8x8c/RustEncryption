# Rust Encryption



Adheres to strict design practices. The apps here are mostly one page of main.rs and a small Cargo.toml file-, which compiles to the executable apps. As such, the apps are incredibly easy to customize or audit. 

This repo is TRUE privacy oriented. The NAMES of each app do not matter. In fact, you are encouraged to re-name the app before you compile it. This is done by editing cargo.toml or simply re-naming the app after it is compiled. 

The design is to have each small app do a single task- and do it well. Large code-bases of more complicated apps are nearly impossible to feed to Ai in order to audit, and they are often large because they WANT the code to be confusing. None of that nonsense here. 

Each app is as simple to run as possible. Large and complicated encryption apps have too many commands.

 The code is one page and super easy to feed to Ai to audit or change. Trusting another closed-source app is absurd. In fact, for years and years, “security”| apps have been found to be made with one form or another of malware or spyware. THE AGE OF Ai IS HERE! You do NOT have to rely on bad actors to code apps for you!
